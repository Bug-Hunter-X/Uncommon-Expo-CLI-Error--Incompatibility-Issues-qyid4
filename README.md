# Uncommon Expo CLI Error: Incompatibility Issues

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered when using the Expo CLI. The error message is often vague, making it difficult to diagnose the root cause. The error typically arises from compatibility problems between Expo modules, dependencies, or React Native versions.

## Problem

When running `expo start` or `expo build`, an unclear error message appears, indicating a general incompatibility.  The message doesn't provide specific details about the conflicting elements.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing dependencies and ensuring compatibility between the Expo CLI version, React Native version, and all installed packages.  This often involves updating packages, downgrading to compatible versions, or cleaning the project's cache and node modules.  A detailed approach is provided in the `expoBugSolution.js` file.
