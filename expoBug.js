This error typically occurs when you try to use a feature or module that isn't compatible with the version of Expo CLI you are using, or when there's a conflict between different Expo packages or dependencies. For example, it might happen if you're using an older version of React Native that isn't compatible with the latest Expo updates.  Sometimes, this error is vaguely reported and doesn't give a very clear indication of what's causing it.
