The solution involves a systematic approach to resolving compatibility issues:

1. **Check Expo CLI and React Native versions:** Ensure your Expo CLI version is compatible with the React Native version used in your project. Consult the official Expo documentation for compatibility information. 
2. **Update packages:** Run `expo update` to update Expo and its dependencies to the latest stable versions.
3. **Review package.json:** Check your `package.json` file for any dependencies that might be causing conflicts. Look for outdated or incompatible packages.
4. **Clean the project:** Delete the `node_modules` folder and run `npm install` or `yarn install` to reinstall your dependencies. This can clear up any corrupted or conflicting files. 
5. **Clear Expo cache:** Run `expo prebuild --clean` to clear the Expo cache. 
6. **Downgrade (if necessary):** If updating doesn't resolve the problem, try downgrading some packages to known compatible versions.  Consult the documentation for the specific modules involved. 
7. **Create a minimal reproducible example:** If the problem persists, create a minimal project that reproduces the error. This will help in isolating the root cause and seeking help from the community.
